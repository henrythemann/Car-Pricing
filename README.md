# Car-Pricing
The process of finding a model to predict car prices

# Findings
In the process of finding the best model, it became clear that the model with the lowest error was one that was restricted to a single model of car. Therefore, a pricing model for the entire dataset would require multiple modelsâ€”one for each model of car.

# Next Steps
The next step would be to start building a model for each car model. This could be expedited by building a web scraper to retrieve necessary information for each car model.
